1. **Matchmaking**  
   Two players are randomly paired. Neither knows if the other is a bot or a human.

2. **Bot Impersonation Strategy**  
   If both players are human, one can **pretend to be a bot**. If they successfully convince the other, they earn **bonus points**.

3. **Guess Time**  
   After 1 minute, each player guesses if their partner was a **human or a bot**.
